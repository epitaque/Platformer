# Platformer
* Aims to be sort of like a game-maker for multiplayer and singleplayer platformer games. 
* There will be an easy way to share and play content with friends.
* All GUIs and block types are not hardcoded, they are parsed from a text file.
* I'm hoping eventually there will live-update levels, where people can play it as somebody is building it. Also a collaboration feature when editing levels so friends can help.
* Uses SFML 64 bit, C++, and I installed the boost library but I haven't done anything with it yet.
* Feel free to contribute! (although I doubt many people will ever see this page, lol)
* I have never developed any games or C++ programs as big as this so the code is probably pretty messy.
